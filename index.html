        <p class="header-text">Uncovered is an anonymous service that lets you speak to a domestic violence survivor who has gone through a similar 
            situation as you. You'll be matched with someone who shares a similar history that you are currently experiencing. 
            You will also be matched with someone from the area as best as possible so you can plan escape routes and nearby resources. Uncovered
            features video chatting, continuous chatting even if you exit the chat, and "emergency exits", if you need to leave the chat
            immediately.
